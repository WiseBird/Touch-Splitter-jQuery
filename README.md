### A high performance splitter system with events, compatible with touch screens

###Features:
* Use your finger to move the splitter left and right
* Fluid resizing using percentages
* Fast and JSLint proof Javascript

### More Info
This project is based on code I needed to write for my internship at RareWire LLC over the summer. I used these splitter calculation methods to improve the splitter system they were previously using in their in-browser IDE that I worked on.
